# Super Crazy Bonus Release

Edit this file to answer the following questions. Give examples. You may need to do a bit of research. :)

1. Why is Hash.fetch useful?
Hash.fetch allows us to pass in default values or expected values for args.

2. What is the disadvantage of single inheritance, and what's a possible solution to that problem?
Mixing in a module is a possible solution to this problem...different classes can share behaviors even if they aren't directly related.

3. Why are these classes initialized with an options hash?
Argument order doesn't matter.

4. What is the purpose of the private keyword in a class? What does it protect you from and why is that valuable?


5. Why are concepts like encapsulation, single responsibility, and abstraction important? Now that you've been programming for a while, have you seen any advantages for yourself, or can you imagine them in the future?
